				<h3>About the project</h3>
				<p align="justify">
				Nowadays, in the era of financial crisis that we live in, was risen a social crisis which caused 
				racist incidents and hate crimes. In this project, the aim is to efficiently visualize the racists 
				incidents that occurred in the United Kingdom in a certain period of time. This is going to be achieved 
				by developing an interactive environment, in this case a website that is going to present different 
				aspects of this subject. 
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				The visualisation of racist incidents in the UK has the form of a website and the included graphs are located
				in the three pages, "Home", "England \& Wales" and "Scotland". Users can chose what aspect of the racist incident
				data they want to visualize and interact with. That can be done by using the main menu and then the sidebar provided
				in each page. The intended audience, the user, of this visualisation is wide that is because it may concern everyone.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				In the home screen users can interact with the map provided and by clicking on it, the total number of incidents for 
				each country and also a global view of the incidents that occurred in UK as a whole. The first impression on seeing 
				these graphs is that the general trend is that the total incidents in UK are being reduced but in the case of Scotland 
				that trend does not apply. Instead of decreasing as it is observed in England and Wales, in Scotland were increased from
				2011 to 2012. Therefore, progress is generally observed as the general trend is the steady decrease of racist incidents 
				and hate crimes.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Moving on the pages "England \& Wales" and "Scotland", there are different option on what aspects of racist incidents data 
				users want to visualise. Regarding England and Wales the total number of incidents per year in each police authority area is
				available along with the crime types and motives for these incidents. However for Scotland the same aspects are available and
				additionally the ethnic groups of victims, complainers and perpetrators. The trend once again in most areas is the gradual 
				decrease of the number of incidents that occur. 
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>About the data</h3>
				<p align="justify">
				The data used in this project were found in government websites, such as data.gov.uk, gov.scot and ons.gov.uk. 
				These sites are a part of the open government concept and often they provide data collected and used from government 
				organizations. In the case of racist incidents the main institution the institution that performed data acquisition 
				is the police force of each local authority area for England, Wales and Scotland. 
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				The police forces recorded all the reported hate crimes in various formats. Each country's police force had a different 
				system of recording such data but the data acquisition period was the same in all cases, from April through March. For example 
				England and Wales recorded only the incidents per local authority area and divided the crimes in three categories, violence, 
				criminal damage, other offenses and in five motives, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and gender. On the other 
				hand Scotland recorded the incidents in more detail. Not only recorded them for each local authority area but also the ethnic 
				groups of victims and perpetrators, their language, age and gender while providing also the percentages for each category apart 
				from the actual recorded numbers. 
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Considering the difference between the format of the data collection per UK country, some issues occurred. Firstly, the inconsistency 
				of the data features that were recorded per country and per year affected the way that the data were going to be visualized, in order 
				to provide a global view on the subject for United Kingdom as a whole. Secondly, the data provided by the government institutions of 
				each country have different recording time periods. For example, regarding England and Wales government sites provided only data about 
				racist incidents that occurred between 2008 and 2012. Regarding Scotland though, the time period of recored data was from 2004 to 2014.
				Finally, unfortunately there were no data found about Northern Ireland.
				</p>
				<h4>Note</h4>
				<p align="justify">
				This website was created as a piece of coursework for the module Information Visualization
				of the MSc Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining of the Uinversity of East Anglia, in Norwich, UK in May 2017.

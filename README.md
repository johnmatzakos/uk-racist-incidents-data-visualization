# Data Visualization of Racist Incidents in the UK

This was a University project that introduced me to the world of JavaScript by creating interactive visualizations.
Other programming languages used in this project apart from JavaScript are HTML and CSS.

The visualizations are displayed in the context of a website, which you can see by clicking the link below:
